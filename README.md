**Quotes:**
* [Jeff Attwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/)-> "Effortful study means constantly tackling problems at the very edge of your ability. Stuff you may have a high probability of failing at. Unless you're failing some of the time, you're probably not growing professionally. You have to seek out those challenges and push yourself beyond your comfort limit." 
* The expert mind -> "Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but "effortful study," which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one's competence. "

* continually tackle challenges that lie just beyond my competence
